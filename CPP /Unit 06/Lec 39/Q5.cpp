Single File Programming Question
Problem Statement



Akshaya is developing a program to calculate the sum of elements in arrays of different data types. Create a program that calculates the sum of elements in two different arrays of integers and double-point numbers using a template function named arraySum. The program should first prompt the user to enter the size of the arrays, followed by the elements of the two arrays.



The arraySum function should take two parameters: the array of any data type and the size of the array, and it should return the sum of all the elements in the array.



The program should print the sum of elements in the integer array and the double-point array separately.

Input format :
The first line consists of an integer n, representing the size of the array.

The second line consists of n space-separated integers, representing the array of integer values.

The third line consists of n space-separated double values, representing the array of double values.

Output format :
The first line prints an integer, representing the sum of an integer array.

The second line prints a double value, representing the sum of the double-point array.



Refer to the sample output for the formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
1 <= n <= 1000: The size of the arrays will be between 1 and 1000 (inclusive).

For the integer array arr1, -109 <= arr1[i] <= 109

For the floating-point array arr2, -109 <= arr2[i] <= 109

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
5
1 2 3 4 5
1.5 2.5 3.5 4.5 5.5
Output 1 :
15
17.5
Input 2 :
3
10 20 30
1.1 2.2 3.3
Output 2 :
60
6.6



#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

template <class T>
T arraySum(T arr[], int n) {
    T sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum += arr[i];
    }
    return sum;
}

int main() {
    int n;
    cin >> n;

    int arr1[n];
    double arr2[n];

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cin >> arr1[i];
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cin >> arr2[i];
    }

    cout << arraySum(arr1, n) << endl;
    cout << arraySum(arr2, n);

    return 0;
}
