Question Paragraph

In a picturesque town, there lived a talented artist named Lily 
who had a unique way of expressing herself through strings. She designed a
CustomString class that could magically invert the case of each character using the unary !
operator.

One day, a curious writer named Mark decided to test Lily’s creation
by entering a sentence into the console. The program displays the original string 
and then applies the overloaded ! operator to invert the case of every character, converting
uppercase letters to lowercase and lowercase letters to uppercase.

This task demonstrates the power of operator overloading in C++ for creative string manipulation.

Note: Use a character array.

Input Format

A single line containing a string of printable ASCII characters

Maximum length: 100 characters



---

Output Format

The output should be displayed in two lines:

1. Original String: followed by the input string


2. Inverted String: followed by the case-inverted string

Sample Test Case

Input

Hello WORLD

Output

Original String: Hello WORLD
Inverted String: hELLO world

Code 


#include <iostream>
#include <cstring>
using namespace std;

class CustomString {
    char str[101];
public:
    CustomString(char s[]) {
        strcpy(str, s);
    }

    void operator!() {
        for (int i = 0; str[i] != '\0'; i++) {
            if (str[i] >= 'A' && str[i] <= 'Z')
                str[i] = str[i] + 32;
            else if (str[i] >= 'a' && str[i] <= 'z')
                str[i] = str[i] - 32;
        }
    }

    void display() {
        cout << str;
    }
};

int main() {
    char input[101];
    cin.getline(input, 101);

    CustomString s(input);

    cout << "Original String: ";
    s.display();
    cout << endl;

    !s;

    cout << "Inverted String: ";
    s.display();

    return 0;
}
