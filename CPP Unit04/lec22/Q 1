Question Paragraph
Pavani is tasked with implementing a class named Distance that 
represents a distance using two units: feet and inches.
The objective is to overload the unary decrement operator (--) so that 
applying it to a Distance object decreases the distance by one foot and one inch.
The program should:
Read user input for feet and inches.
Apply the overloaded decrement operator.
Display the updated distance in the format feet'inches.
Input Format
Two integers separated by a space:
First integer represents feet
Second integer represents inches
Output Format

Display the updated distance after decrement in the format:

feet'inches
Constraints

1 ≤ feet ≤ 100

1 ≤ inches ≤ 12
Sample Test Case

Input

8 9

Output

7'8



#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Distance {
    int feet;
    int inches;
public:
    Distance(int f, int i) {
        feet = f;
        inches = i;
    }

    void operator--() {
        feet--;
        inches--;
        if (inches < 0) {
            inches = 11;
            feet--;
        }
    }

    void display() {
        cout << feet << "'" << inches;
    }
};

int main() {
    int f, i;
    cin >> f >> i;
    Distance d(f, i);
    --d;
    d.display();
    return 0;
}
