Single File Programming Question
Problem statement



Raj is managing a small grocery store and wants to keep track of the items he sells, along with their prices. To do this, he creates a Shop class that allows him to set the price of items using the virtual function setPrice().



He then defines a ConcreteShop class that inherits from Shop to handle the specifics of his store. By inputting the number of items and their respective IDs and prices, Raj can store this information efficiently. After adding all the items, he can display the list of item IDs with their prices, along with the total price of all items in the store.

Input format :
The first line contains an integer n, the number of items.

The next n lines each contain two space-separated integers: the item ID and the item price.

Output format :
The output consists of n lines, each formatted as: "ID: <itemId> Price: <itemPrice>".

The last line should display the total price of all items, formatted as: "Total Price: <totalPrice>".



Refer to the sample output for the formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
1 ≤ n ≤ 100

Each item ID is unique and within the range of 1 to 1000.

Each item's price is a non-negative integer within the range of 0 to 10000.

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
3
1 100
2 200
3 300
Output 1 :
ID: 1 Price: 100
ID: 2 Price: 200
ID: 3 Price: 300
Total Price: 600
Input 2 :
4
11 25
22 54
33 72
44 90
Output 2 :
ID: 11 Price: 25
ID: 22 Price: 54
ID: 33 Price: 72
ID: 44 Price: 90
Total Price: 241
