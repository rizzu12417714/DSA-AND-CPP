Problem Statement

During an archaeological expedition, a team discovers the Disk of Light, consisting of multiple disks arranged on three pedestals: Source (A), Auxiliary (B), and Illuminated (C).
All disks are initially placed on pedestal A, with smaller disks on top of larger ones.

The objective is to move all disks from Source (A) to Illuminated (C) by following these rules:

1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.


2. A disk can only be placed on top of a larger disk or on an empty pedestal.


3. All moves must follow the correct order of the ritual.



You must write a program using recursion to display the sequence of moves and finally print the total number of times the disk is moved.

Input Format

The input consists of a single integer n, representing the number of disks.



---

Output Format

Print each move in the format:
Move disk X from A to C

The last line prints the total number of moves in the format:
Total number of times the disk is moved: Y

Constraints

0 < n ≤ 8

C++ Code (Without Comments, Using Recursion)

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int cnt = 0;

void tower(int n, char from, char aux, char to)
{
    if (n == 0)
        return;

    tower(n - 1, from, to, aux);
    cout << "Move disk " << n << " from " << from << " to " << to << endl;
    cnt++;
    tower(n - 1, aux, from, to);
}

int main()
{
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    tower(n, 'A', 'B', 'C');
    cout << "Total number of times the disk is moved: " << cnt;
    return 0;
}
