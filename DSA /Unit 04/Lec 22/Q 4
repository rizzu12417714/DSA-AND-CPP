Problem Statement

In a mystical kingdom, magical disks of different sizes are stacked on a Source Peg.
The goal is to transfer all disks to the Destination Peg using a Helper Peg, following the rules of the Tower of Hanoi:

1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.


2. A larger disk can never be placed on a smaller disk.


3. The Helper Peg may be used temporarily.



Using the Tower of Hanoi algorithm, calculate the minimum number of moves required to transfer all disks from the Source Peg to the Destination Peg.


---

Input Format

A single integer n, representing the number of disks.



---

Output Format

Print a single integer representing the minimum number of moves required to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem for n disks.



---

Constraints

0 < n < 8

Explanation (Conceptual)

The minimum number of moves required to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem for n disks is:

2^n - 1

This comes from the recursive nature of the problem:

Move n-1 disks to helper peg

Move the largest disk

Move n-1 disks to destination peg

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

long long hanoi(int n)
{
    if (n == 0)
        return 0;
    return 2 * hanoi(n - 1) + 1;
}

int main()
{
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    cout << hanoi(n);
    return 0;
}
