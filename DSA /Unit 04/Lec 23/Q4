Problem Paragraph

In a mystical land known as Eldoria, ancient wizards use magical runes to cast powerful spells.
Each rune is represented by a single character, and its magical potency is determined by its ASCII value.
For the spells to work correctly, the runes must be arranged in a specific order.
Your task is to write a program that uses merge sort with recursion to arrange the magical 
runes in descending order of their magical potency (ASCII value).
Input Format
The first line contains an integer n, representing the number of magical runes.
The second line contains n space-separated characters, each representing a magical rune.
Output Format
Print a single line containing the magical runes sorted in descending order of ASCII
value, separated by spaces.
Constraints
1 ≤ n ≤ 25
Each character is a single uppercase or lowercase English letter
Sample Test Case 1
Input
8
G h I j K L m n
Output
n m h L K j I G
Sample Test Case 2
Input
6
a Z A B M Z
Output
a Z Z M B A




C++ Code 

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void merge(char a[], int l, int m, int r) {
    int n1 = m - l + 1;
    int n2 = r - m;
    char L[n1], R[n2];
    for(int i = 0; i < n1; i++) L[i] = a[l + i];
    for(int j = 0; j < n2; j++) R[j] = a[m + 1 + j];
    int i = 0, j = 0, k = l;
    while(i < n1 && j < n2) {
        if(L[i] >= R[j]) a[k++] = L[i++];
        else a[k++] = R[j++];
    }
    while(i < n1) a[k++] = L[i++];
    while(j < n2) a[k++] = R[j++];
}

void mergeSort(char a[], int l, int r) {
    if(l < r) {
        int m = (l + r) / 2;
        mergeSort(a, l, m);
        mergeSort(a, m + 1, r);
        merge(a, l, m, r);
    }
}

int main() {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    char a[n];
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) cin >> a[i];
    mergeSort(a, 0, n - 1);
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        cout << a[i] << " ";
    return 0;
}
