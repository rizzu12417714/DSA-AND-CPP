Problem Paragraph

You are working as a program developer at a renowned sports academy.
As part of the academy’s performance evaluation system, you are tasked with 
sorting athletes based on their heights in descending order.

You are given a list of athlete names along with their corresponding heights.
Your task is to implement the Quick Sort algorithm to sort the athletes’ names in
descending order based on their heights.
Input Format
The first line contains an integer N, representing the number of athletes.
The next N lines contain the athlete’s name followed by their height, separated by a space.
Output Format
Print the athletes’ names sorted in descending order of their heights, separated by spaces.
Constraints
N = names.length = heights.length
Athlete names contain only uppercase and lowercase English letters
All height values are distinct
