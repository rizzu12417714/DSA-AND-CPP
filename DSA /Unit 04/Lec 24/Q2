Problem Paragraph

You are working as a software developer in a logistics company.
Your task is to create a program that efficiently sorts a list of packages based on
their weights using the Quick Sort algorithm.
Each package has a weight value, and the packages must be arranged in ascending
order according to their weights.


---

Input Format

The first line contains an integer N, representing the number of packages.

The second line contains N space-separated integers, representing the weights of the packages.
Output Format

Print N integers representing the package weights sorted in ascending order, separated by spaces.

Constraints
1 ≤ N ≤ 10
1 ≤ weight ≤ 100

Sample Test Case
Input
4
15 25 35 10
Output
10 15 25 35



C++ Code


#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int partition(int arr[], int low, int high) {
    int pivot = arr[high];
    int i = low - 1;
    for(int j = low; j < high; j++) {
        if(arr[j] < pivot) {
            i++;
            int t = arr[i];
            arr[i] = arr[j];
            arr[j] = t;
        }
    }
    int t = arr[i + 1];
    arr[i + 1] = arr[high];
    arr[high] = t;
    return i + 1;
}

void quickSort(int arr[], int low, int high) {
    if(low < high) {
        int pi = partition(arr, low, high);
        quickSort(arr, low, pi - 1);
        quickSort(arr, pi + 1, high);
    }
}

void printArray(int arr[], int size) {
    for(int i = 0; i < size; i++)
        cout << arr[i] << " ";
}

int main() {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    int arr[n];
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        cin >> arr[i];
    quickSort(arr, 0, n - 1);
    printArray(arr, n);
    return 0;
}
