🟦 Problem Statement
Lucas is an engineer working with a robot to move disks between three rods in a factory.
Each rod has a set of disks, where each disk is larger than the one above it.
The goal is to move all the disks from the source rod to the target rod, using the auxiliary rod for temporary storage, while following these rules:
Only one disk can be moved at a time.
A larger disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller disk.
Lucas needs to find how many moves are required and print each move performed by the robot.
Help Lucas by implementing a solution to calculate the total number of moves and print the sequence of moves.
🟦 Input Format
The input contains an integer n, representing the number of disks.
🟦 Output Format
For each move, print the following format:
Copy code

move disk X from rod source to rod destination
where X is the disk number being moved.
After printing all the moves, print the total number of moves on a new line.
🟦 Code Constraints
�
The rods are labeled as "1", "2", and "3"

🟦 C++ Code 

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int totalMoves = 0;

void moveDisks(int n, int source, int auxiliary, int destination) {
    if (n == 1) {
        cout << "move disk 1 from rod " << source << " to rod " << destination << endl;
        totalMoves++;
        return;
    }
    moveDisks(n - 1, source, destination, auxiliary);
    cout << "move disk " << n << " from rod " << source << " to rod " << destination << endl;
    totalMoves++;
    moveDisks(n - 1, auxiliary, source, destination);
}

int main() {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    moveDisks(n, 1, 2, 3);
    cout << totalMoves;
    return 0;
}
