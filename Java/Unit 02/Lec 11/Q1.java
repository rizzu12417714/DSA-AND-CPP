Single File Programming Question
Problem Statement



David is trying to solve a linear equation to find the values of x and y based on given coefficients a, b and c. Implement a class named Equation where the coefficients are inputted through a method named inputCoefficients(). Create an object of the Equation class, use the method to input the coefficients, and another method solveEquation() to solve and display the values of x and y.



Can you assist David in creating the program?



Formula: 

x = (c - b) / a

y = (c - a) / b

Input format :
The input consists of three double values :

The first line contains the input a representing the coefficient of the linear equations which is of type double.
The second line contains the input b representing the coefficient of the linear equations which is of type double.
The third line contains the input c representing the coefficient of the linear equations which is of type double.
Output format :
The first line of output prints one of the following:

If there is a solution for x, print "x = " followed by the result as a double value, rounded off to one decimal place.
If a is zero and no solution exists, print "a is zero".
The second line prints one of the following:

If there is a solution for y, print "y = " followed by the result as a double value, rounded off to one decimal place.
If b is zero and no solution exists, print "b is zero".


Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
The given test cases fall under the following constraints:

0.0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 100.0

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
2.0
