Single File Programming Question
Problem Statement



A multiplayer word-guessing game is one where one player needs to input words and another player guesses the same word. 



Write a class, WordEntry, with a String field to store player inputs. Override the equals() method in a way that compares the words while ignoring all spaces and cases. The program determines the winner of a word-guessing game, where player 2 wins upon successfully guessing the word entered by player 1, and player 1 emerges victorious if player 2 fails to guess the word.

Input format :
The first line of input consists of a string, representing the word entered by player 1.

The second line consists of a string, representing the word entered by player 2.

Output format :
If player 2 successfully guesses the word entered by player 1 (comparison must ignore spaces and case), the output prints "Player 2 wins!"

If player 2 fails to guess the word entered by player 1, the output prints "Player 1 wins!"



Refer to the sample output for the exact text.

Code constraints :
In this scenario, the test cases fall under the following constraints:

1 ≤ length of the input strings ≤ 100 characters

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
Red Apple

Output 1 :
Player 2 wins!
