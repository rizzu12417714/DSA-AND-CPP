Single File Programming Question
Problem Statement



Akash is learning programming and wants to understand the concept of the final keyword. His friend Roshini gave him a task to calculate the area of a rhombus using the final keyword.



Create a base class named Shape with a method calculateArea() that can be overridden by subclasses. Then, create a final class Rhombus that extends Shape and contains private final member variables diagonal1 and diagonal2, representing the lengths of the diagonals. Implement a constructor to initialize these values and override the calculateArea() method to compute the area.



Formula: 

area = (0.5 * diagonal1 * diagonal2).

Input format :
The input consists of two space-separated double values, representing the length of the diagonals.

Output format :
The output prints a double value representing the area of the rhombus, rounded off to two decimal places.



Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
The given test cases fall under the following constraints:

1.0 ≤ diagonals ≤ 170.0

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
15.3 12.5
Output 1 :
95.63
Input 2 :
1.0 8.6
Output 2 :
4.30
Input 3 :
159.3 170.0
Output 3 :
13540.50

import java.util.Scanner;

// Base class
class Shape {

    // Method to calculate area (can be overridden)
    double calculateArea() {
        return 0;
    }
}

// Final class Rhombus
final class Rhombus extends Shape {

    // Final member variables
    private final double diagonal1;
    private final double diagonal2;

    // Constructor to initialize diagonals
    Rhombus(double diagonal1, double diagonal2) {
        this.diagonal1 = diagonal1;
        this.diagonal2 = diagonal2;
    }

    // Override calculateArea method
    @Override
    double calculateArea() {
        return 0.5 * diagonal1 * diagonal2;
    }
}

// Main class
public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        double diagonal1 = scanner.nextDouble();
        double diagonal2 = scanner.nextDouble();

        Rhombus rhombus = new Rhombus(diagonal1, diagonal2);

        double area = rhombus.calculateArea();

        System.out.printf("%.2f\n", area);

        scanner.close();
    }
}
