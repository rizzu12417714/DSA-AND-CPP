Single File Programming Question
Problem Statement



Rithish is developing a straightforward pizza ordering system. To achieve this, he needs a Pizza class with a constructor for the base price and topping cost, along with a calculatePrice method overriding. He also wants a DiscountedPizza class that inherits from Pizza, applying a 10% discount for more than three toppings.



The program prompts the user for inputs, creates instances of both classes, calculates regular and discounted prices, and displays them formatted appropriately.



Example 1



Input:

9.5

1.25

3

Output: 

Price without discount: Rs.13.25

Price with discount: Rs.13.25

Explanation:

Rithish orders a pizza with a base price of Rs. 9.5, a topping cost of Rs. 1.25, and selects 3 toppings. The price is calculated as 9.5 + (1.25 * 3) = 13.25. The regular and discounted prices are both Rs. 13.25, as no discount has been applied.



Example 2



Input:

11.0

2.0

7

Output: 

Price without discount: Rs.25.00

Price with discount: Rs.22.50

Explanation:

Rithish orders another pizza with a higher base price of Rs. 11.0, a topping cost of Rs. 2.0, and chooses 7 toppings. 

Regular Price: 11.0 + (2.0 * 7) = Rs. 25.00.

Discounted Price: The discounted price is calculated as 90% of the regular price, i.e., 0.9 * 25.00 = Rs.22.50. 

Input format :
The first line of input consists of a double value, representing the base price of the pizza.

The second line consists of a double value, representing the cost per topping.

The third line consists of an integer, representing the number of toppings chosen for the pizza.

Output format :
The first line of output prints "Price without discount: Rs. " followed by a double value representing the price without discount, rounded off to two decimal places.

The second line prints "Price with discount: Rs. " followed by a double value representing the price with the discount, rounded off to two decimal places.



Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
The base price and the cost per topping should be greater than zero.

1.0 ≤ price of the pizza ≤100.0

1.0 ≤ cost per topping ≤100.0

1 ≤ number of toppings ≤ 10

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
9.5
1.25
3
Output 1 :
Price without discount: Rs.13.25
Price with discount: Rs.13.25
Input 2 :
11.0
2.0
7
Output 2 :
Price without discount: Rs.25.00
Price with discount: Rs.22.50
