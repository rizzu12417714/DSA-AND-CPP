Problem Statement

You are working in a warehouse where products are assigned IDs ranging from 0 to N-1.
You are given a list of product IDs in ascending order.
Your task is to identify all product IDs that appear exactly twice in the list and print them in ascending order.

If no duplicate elements are found, print -1.
The solution must be implemented using recursion.


---

Input Format

The first line contains an integer N, representing the size of the array.

The second line contains N space-separated integers, representing the array elements in ascending order.



---

Output Format

Print a space-separated list of integers that occur twice in the array.

If no duplicates exist, print -1.



---

Constraints

1 ≤ N ≤ 25

Array elements are already in ascending order

C++ Code (Without Comments, Using Recursion)

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void findDuplicates(int a[], int n, int i, bool &found)
{
    if (i >= n - 1)
        return;

    if (a[i] == a[i + 1])
    {
        cout << a[i] << " ";
        found = true;
        findDuplicates(a, n, i + 2, found);
    }
    else
        findDuplicates(a, n, i + 1, found);
}

int main()
{
    int n;
    cin >> n;

    int a[25];
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        cin >> a[i];

    bool found = false;
    findDuplicates(a, n, 0, found);

    if (!found)
        cout << -1;

    return 0;
}
