Problem Statement

You are given T test cases.
Each test case consists of two integers a and b, where a is the base and b is the exponent.
Your task is to compute a raised to the power b for each test case and print the result on a new line.

You must implement an efficient power() function using recursion to calculate the result.

Input Format

The first line contains an integer T, representing the number of test cases.

The next T lines each contain two space-separated integers a and b.



---

Output Format

For each test case, print a single integer on a new line representing aᵇ.

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 10

0 ≤ a ≤ 200

0 ≤ b ≤ 10
